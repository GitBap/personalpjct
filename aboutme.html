                <p class="description">Hi! My name is Handel Oliver Baptiste. I've always been interested by technology since it's a big part of our generation now. 
                I learned about computer science in 2021 which is why, after college I decided to pursue a career in cybersecurity or web development. 
                Both fields are really interesting for me, which is why I'm currently studying both. </p>
